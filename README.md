# 📊 Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis (2010–2020)

## Dataset: Crowdfunding Campaigns (2010–2020)

This project analyzes a dataset of crowdfunding campaigns launched between 2010 and 2020. The dataset includes campaign categories, statuses (successful, failed, live, canceled), geographical distribution, backer statistics, and financial goals.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This analysis explores trends and performance metrics across crowdfunding campaigns to understand what contributes to campaign success or failure. The objective is to identify category-specific patterns, evaluate statistical metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation, and highlight factors that influence campaign outcomes.

## 👥 Who Can Benefit from This Analysis?

* **Aspiring campaign creators**: Understand what makes a campaign more likely to succeed.
* **Investors/backers**: Gain insights into campaign reliability by category and timing.
* **Platform designers** (e.g., Kickstarter, Indiegogo): Discover patterns that can inform UX and recommendation algorithms.
* **Market researchers and analysts**: Use findings for industry trend evaluations.

This analysis reveals practical, data-driven insights that support better decision-making in launching or evaluating crowdfunding efforts.

## ⚙️ How the Analysis Was Conducted

* **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel
* **Data Source**: Crowdfunding campaign records from 2010 to 2020 (source not explicitly specified in the dataset)

**Statistical Methods Applied**:

* **Central Tendency**: Both mean and median were calculated to measure typical backer counts.

  * Median was determined to be more reliable due to the presence of extreme outliers.
* **Dispersion Metrics**: Standard deviation was analyzed to understand variability.

  * Successful campaigns showed higher standard deviation, influenced by a few high-performing outliers.
* **Category-Level Breakdown**: Campaigns were analyzed by type (e.g., Theatre, Film & Video) and subcategories (e.g., Play, Animation).
* **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Time-series data was reviewed to identify trends across months and years.

## 📌 Key Findings

### 1. Theatre Campaigns

* Exhibited high activity across all outcomes:

  * **Successes**: 187 out of 200
  * **Failures**: 132 out of 140
  * **Cancellations**: 23 out of 25
* Subcategory “Play” dominated within Theatre.
* These campaigns efficiently met their funding goals but were less likely to remain live compared to other categories.

### 2. Film & Video Campaigns

* The most frequently active category.
* Dominated in regions like the United States, Great Britain, and Australia.
* Subcategories such as Animation, Documentary, and Drama drove high engagement.
* Maintained the largest number of live campaigns, especially in higher-density areas.

### 3. Seasonal Performance Trends

* Campaign success declined from July to September consistently across the years.
* These months also recorded higher failure and cancellation rates.
* Possible causes include summer distractions and back-to-school timing.
* Despite this dip, overall campaign success outnumbered failures, and cancellations remained rare.

## 📉 Statistical Insight Highlights

**Median vs. Mean**

* Median offered a more accurate representation of backer behavior, as it reduced distortion from unusually high or low numbers.

**Variance and Standard Deviation**

* Successful campaigns had high variance due to a few viral projects.
* Failed campaigns showed tighter distributions, indicating lower engagement and predictability.

## ✅ Conclusion

This Excel-based analysis reveals that certain campaign types, such as Theatre and Film & Video, have distinct behavioral patterns. Success is influenced by category type, timing, and geographical reach. Median is a more dependable metric than mean for analyzing backer behavior due to the presence of extreme outliers. Seasonal trends also impact campaign outcomes, with noticeable dips in success during mid-year months.
